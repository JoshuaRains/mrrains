        <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">An Analysis of my Spanish Accent as compared to Native Speakers</h1>
        <div class="name_date">
        <p>By Joshua Rains</p>

        <h1>Language Profile</h1>
        <p>
            In this study I will be analyzing the sound production of myself and native speakers of the Mexican variety of Spanish. I will record myself speaking both English and my non-native language of Spanish to determine how my sound production differs from the target speakers whose accent I wish to adopt into my own speaking. In my reflection I will compare my vowel production between English and Spanish and compare my Spanish vowel production to that of the native speaker. One speaker I have selected is a female twitch streamer from Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico who provides longform content which will give plenty of acoustic data to contribute to this study. The other speaker comes from a <a href="https://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/voces_hispanicas/mexico/mexicodf.htm" class="links" target="_blank">website </a> that seeks to archive the different accents of the Spanish speaking world (Instituto Cervantes). This speaker is a male also from Mexico. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to better understand the influences on my own accent development, it is important to highlight my own story of acquiring the Spanish language. I started learning Spanish in middle school, using language learning apps as a base. From the beginning, I put a lot of emphasis on attempting to pronounce things correctly. The majority of my time spent on those apps was spent repeating the words many times to attempt to sound the most like the clips. It is also important to note that at this age I did have the motivation to sound as native as possible due to the negative connotations surrounding the Spanish ‘gringo’ accent.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The majority of my friends at this age were native Spanish speakers. Though I did not have the proficiency to engage in conversation with them, I was able to listen to their conversations in Spanish and their English accents which may have been affected by their native Spanish. In turn, this may have affected the development of my Spanish accent. At this age I was also told that my accent was near native, which may have led me to not focus as heavily on that aspect of language learning going forward.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Accent Profile</h1>
        <p>
            I started by taking a section of the recordings of each of the native speakers and getting the average formants for each of the vowels present in Spanish which are identified as /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/ (Munoz-Basols chap. 2). I then took samples of my own speech, using the same words as well as additional words to get data on my own production of those Spanish vowel sounds. Then I mapped out the sounds in my native phonetic inventory for English using words that adequately showed those vowels. The averages of the data were placed on a chart to visualize the distances between the vowels. The formants 1 and 2 of each vowel were used as the axes, using the bark scale to more effectively display the data.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Observations on the Vowels of the Native Speakers</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="NativeVowelSpace.svg" alt="Vowel Space Chart" width="100%">
            <figcaption>Figure 1: Vowel Space Comparison</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>
        <p>
            Based on the data that I have collected; it appears that the male speaker of Spanish uses less of his overall available vowel space than his female counterpart, while raising his vowels across the board. This can be seen in figure 1. This is especially apparent, as the /i/ and /e/ are much closer together than would be ideal for maintaining ease of understanding.
        </p>
        <br>
        

        <h2>Observations on Vowels</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="FullChartLabeled.svg" alt="Vowel Space Chart" width="100%">
            <figcaption>Figure 2: Vowel Placement Comparison</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>

        <p>
            From the figure 2 we can observe a few things. My Spanish /u/ sound is very close to that of the female native speaker. This sound is probably one of the easier ones for me to replicate due to its proximity to the /ʊ/ from the phonetic inventory of my native language.
        </p>
        <p>
            A similar phenomenon occurs with my Spanish /e/ sound which I produce very closely to the /ɪ/ sound from English. This places it near where I would predict that the male /e/ sound would appear, following the pattern of reducing overall vowel space used in the mouth in comparison with the female speaker. It does, however, appear more raised than expected in the male speaker.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The /i/ sound is also fairly close to those of the native speakers, appearing nicely in-between them. It also appears that when speaking Spanish I attempt to bring the /i/ further back than in English. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The most obvious difference between my vowels and those of the native speaker are /o/ and /a/. While my /o/ can be seen as remotely close to the target, being too fronted, but still being in-between the two native speakers, I was shocked to find that the /a/ is being produced among the back rounded vowels.  
        </p>
        <p>
            These observations present a few areas that I need to work on to sound more like a native speaker. I should use my English /ʌ/ phoneme as a model for producing the Spanish /o/ as it is almost identical to the native speaker’s /o/ sound. I should also start using my English /æ/ sound as a model for the /a/ sound, as this would put it exactly between the two native speakers. An example of my current /a/ sound can be seen in Figure 5-1.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Observations on Consonants</h2>
        <p>
            When setting out to understand the difference in consonant pronunciation between native and non-native speakers of a language, it is important to first understand the phonetic inventories of the language in question and the first language of the speaker. In this case, we are comparing the consonants naturally found in Spanish and English. Figure 3 displays this comparison in which the sounds highlighted in red are of special interest to this discussion as they are the sounds found in Spanish but not English and are therefore the most likely sounds that I would have issues producing. The data for the native phonetic inventories was taken from the <a href="https://accent.gmu.edu/browse_native.php" class="links" target="_blank">Speech Accent Archive </a> (Weinberger).

        <br>
        <p>
            The word /tɾaβaxando/ presents a good example word that will allow us to look at several of these sounds.

        </figure>
        <p>
            Here we can observe a few things. The /β/ appears to be realized correctly. If produced incorrectly, I would likely be approximating it as a /b/ sound as this is the closest sound present in my native language. There is evidence against this taking place because the spectrogram does not show a visible plosive release signature like we see with the /d/ sound. Similarly, it appears that the tap /ɾ/ is produced correctly as there are no formant lines in this sound to suggest that it was produced as an approximant /ɹ/. The /x/ sound also appears to be realized correctly.</p>
        
       
        <p>
            Another place of comparison between the consonants that I produce and those of the native speakers are the endings of certain words. In word /kaliðað/ for example the native speaker leaves off the final consonant. This is something not present in my speech, where the /ð/ is clearly pronounced         </p>

        <p>
            When producing approximant clusters, it also appears that I do not separate the sounds as much as native speakers. This can be seen the following figures 4 and 5 which compare the spectogram of my pronunciation of /lograrlo/ with that of the female native speaker (see the green arrow).

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            Overall, this study presents useful information about my own accent that I will be able to use when teaching my Spanish class in the future. Through looking at this report, students will be able to better understand the aspects that go into one’s accent in a foreign language like native phonetic inventory. Students may also gain an understanding of how speech sounds can be quantified and analyzed. The native phonetic inventory comparison chart that I made will also be useful to me if I choose to teach English as a second language because it will allow students to see what sounds may be more difficult for them to produce. This project has also given me an understanding of the areas in which I could improve my Spanish accent.
