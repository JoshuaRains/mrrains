        <p>
    In this study I will be analyzing the sound production of myself and a native speaker of the Mexican variety of Spanish. I will record myself speaking both English and my non-native language of Spanish to determine how my sound production differs from the target speaker whose accent I wish to adopt into my own speaking. In my reflection I will compare my vowel production between English and Spanish and compare my Spanish vowel production to that of the native speaker. The speaker I have selected is a twitch streamer who provides longform content which will give plenty of acoustic data to contribute to this study.
</p>

<p>
    I started by taking a section of one of the recordings of the native speaker and getting the average formants for each of the vowels present in Spanish which are identified as /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/ (Munoz-Basols chap. 2). I then took samples of my own speech, using the same words as well as additional words to get data on my own production of those Spanish vowel sounds. Then I mapped out the sounds in my native phonetic inventory for English.
</p>

<p>
    From the chart we can observe a few things. My Spanish /u/ sound is very close to that of the native speaker. This sound is probably one of the easier ones for me to replicate due to its proximity to the /ʊ/ from the phonetic inventory of my native language.
</p>

<p>
    A similar phenomenon occurs with my Spanish /e/ sound which I produce very closely to the /ɪ/ sound from English, this however distances me from the native speaker. This difference may not inhibit understanding because my /e/ and /i/ of Spanish remain a good distance apart.
</p>

<p>
    The /i/ sound is also fairly close to that of the native speaker. It also appears that when speaking Spanish I attempt to bring the /i/ further back than in English.
</p>

<p>
    The most obvious difference between my vowels and those of the native speaker are /o/ and /a/. While my /o/ can be seen as remotely close to the target, being too fronted, I was shocked to find that the /a/ is being produced among the back rounded vowels.
</p>

<p>
    These observations present a few areas that I need to work on to sound more like a native speaker. I should use my English /ʌ/ phoneme as a model for producing the Spanish /o/ as it is almost identical to the native speaker’s /o/ sound. I should also start using my English /æ/ sound as a model for the /a/ sound, attempting to lower it as much as possible.
